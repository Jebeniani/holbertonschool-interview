## Sandpiles
about this project ::
```bash
Prototype: void sandpiles_sum(int grid1[3][3], int grid2[3][3]);

Both grid1 and grid2 are individually stable
A sandpile is considered stable when none of its cells contains more than 3 grains
When my function is done, grid1 must be stable
grid1 must be printed before each toppling round, only if it is unstable
I am not allowed to allocate memory dynamically
